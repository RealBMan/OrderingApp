# OrderingApp
This is a basic app that was developed as a HighSchool project that allows students order food from nearby stores on one global uniform app. 
This app uses SQL databases to keep track of the students login details.
Parts of the code and the basic concept of this app/idea was inspired by this Youtube video: 
This application/project is no way affiloated with any of the stores mentioned in the app. This was simply a creative idea that used these stores as a
prototype/placeholder.

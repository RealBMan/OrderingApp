# OrderingApp
This is a basic app that was developed as a HighSchool project that allows students order food from nearby stores on one global uniform app to mitiagte wait times to get food and to reduce wait times by waiting in lines. The aim of this app is to add the local food stores around the highschool area into a single app that allows the students order their food from even before they step out. So all they need to do is to go out and pick up their food, ensuring that their lunch time is not wasted and they can get back to classes on time. 
This app uses SQL databases to keep track of the students login details.
Parts of the code and the basic concept of this app/idea was inspired by this Youtube video: https://youtu.be/3vauM7axnRs (especially the conncetion to the SQL database and the CNX file). 


	This application/project is no way affiloated with any of the stores mentioned in the code/filenames. This was simply a creative idea that used stores within the highschool area as a prototype.
